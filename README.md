###### My favorite museum to visit is Sudha Car Museum
> Sudha Cars Museum is an **automobile museum** located in Hyderabad, India. The museum displays "crazy cars" that resemble everyday objects. These cars are handmade by __Kanyaboyina Sudhakar__ who started it as his hobby in his school days and opened the dedicated museum in 2010.
